    "+ Was it necessary to convert to pandas to calculate the moving average return?\n",
    "\n",
    "    + It is not strictly necessary to convert a Dask DataFrame to a pandas DataFrame to calculate the moving average return. Dask DataFrames are designed to handle large datasets that do not fit into memory and provide functionality similar to pandas, including operations like moving averages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ Would it have been better to do it in Dask? Why?\n",
    "    + Yes, it would generally be better to perform the moving average calculation in Dask, especially if you are working with large datasets that do not fit into memory. Here are some reasons why:\n",
    "        + Dask is designed to handle large datasets by breaking them into smaller, manageable partitions and performing computations in parallel. This allows you to work with data that exceeds the available memory on a single machine.\n",
    "        + Dask can distribute computations across multiple cores or even multiple machines, which can significantly speed up processing times for large datasets.\n",
    "        + Dask processes data in chunks, meaning it only loads a portion of the data into memory at any given time. This prevents memory overflow issues that can occur when trying to process large datasets with pandas.\n",
    "        + Dask's API is very similar to pandas, making it easy to transition code from pandas to Dask with minimal changes.\n",
    "        + Converting between Dask and pandas can be time-consuming and memory-intensive. By staying within Dask, you avoid the overhead associated with these conversions.\n",
